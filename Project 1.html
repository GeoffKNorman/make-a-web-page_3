    <!-- Table of contents and Lessons 1 - 2 are copied from Andy's Example!!  

    My own content is all of Lesson 3, as I feel pretty comfortable with the concepts in the previous lessons and would rather focus on getting into the next stage than reinventing the wheel with the earlier lesson notes.

    However!  I would love to know how much of this is appropriate as an assignment and if I need to add more content of my own?  More playing around with CSS and such?  

    Also, the CSS style is copied from Andy's example, as I really liked what was there and honestly didn't see much reason to change it for now.  I'm really more interested in learning more CSS properties and how to efficinetly ADD content without having to copy and paste opening and closing tags, and instead how to import content from a separate file, like a text document, that I can format and keep separate until it comes time to arrange it....Or even creating my own Wordpress style text boxes that I can format intuitively like in a word editing program instead of having to copy and paste opening and closing tag constantly....That's my excuse at least...

        How the Web Works

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with
          each other. When a person goes to a web page like
          www.google.com, their computer sends a
          <em>HTTP Request</em> to
          a <em>server</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends
          it back to the user's computer where a <em>
          web browser</em> interprets the page and displays it on
          the user's screen.

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup
          Language.</em> HTML documents form the majority of the
          content on the web.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML documents contain <em>text
          content</em> which describes "what you see" and
          <em>markup</em> which describes
          "how it looks". <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340">This

          HTML documents are made of HTML
          <b>elements</b>. When writing HTML, we
          tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML
          <b>tags</b>.

        <p>
          Computers are stupid because they interpret
          instructions literally. This makes them very
          unforgiving since a small mistake by a
          programmer can cause huge problems in a program.

        Inline vs Block Elements

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          HTML elements are either <b>inline</b>
          or <b>block</b>. Block elements form
          an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.

        The "tree-like structure" of HTML
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML
          elements can have other elements inside of them. You can
          draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother
          had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on...
        </p>
        <p>
          In a browser, this structure shows up as a series
          of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes
          inside of boxes, and so on...

        <p>
          When you read an HTML document as
          <em>text</em>, you see a wave of
          changing indentations going up and down the left side
          of the document. The more indented an element is, the
          more deeply nested its corresponding "box" is.

        Text Editors (for programming)

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          When writing code, programmers use special text editors
          (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the
          programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors
          will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you
          write an opening tag.

    <h2>Lesson 3: Adding CSS Style to HTML Structure</h2>

    <div class="concept">
      <div class="concept-title" id="lesson-3-1">
        Adding CSS to an HTML Document 
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
        	In order to add CSS to an HTML document, between the &lt;Head&gt; tags, the following must be included:  
          &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css"&gt;
          <br>
          Where href refers to the name of the separate CSS document, which in this lesson, needs to be placed in the same location as the HTML document.
        </p>

    <div class="concept">
      <div class="concept-title" id="lesson-3-2">
        CSS as Cascading Style Sheet
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
        	CSS allows for you to replace properties of parts of your HTML with other properties easily, and allows for different portions of HTML to inherit the properties from their parent class.  In this case, the &lt;div class="something"&gt; blocks we are working with, allows us to apply a style property to the overall box containing everything, like a fonts and margin sizes:  
        	<br><br>
        	.concept-description { 
        	<br> font-weight: lighter; 
        	<br> margin: 6px;
        	<br> }
        	<br> <br> Now every box that doesn't have the property font-weight specified, that is nested in .concept-description, will have the same property and thus <em> inherit </em> as a child, the property of it's parent.

        Flex Boxes?
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
        	I'm still deeply confused by how flex boxes work, but adding the flex property to our container allows for boxes within it to appear next to each other in a particular order and direction.  In this case, the main example I was working with was: <br>
    		<br>
        	.app {
			<br>max-width: 1138px;
			<br>margin: 0 auto;
			<br>display: -webkit-flex;
    		<br>display: flex;
    		<br>}
    		<br><br> Where .app contained most of the body of the page.

        Adding Images
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
        Similarly to linking a CSS document, we can add images to our website with the following <br>
        	&lt;div class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="images/app.png"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        	<br><br>
        	However, for now it must be placed in the same folder as our HTML document.  This creates a box that can be styled as a container for the image.  In my other HTML document I have the css properties as:
        	<br><br>
        	.image { 
        	<br>max-width: 460px;
			<br>}
			<br><br>

        Avoiding Repitition
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
        One of the most common problems is repeating oneself when building anything in code.  CSS helps alot with avoiding repitition as you can create a set of classes that most of your content falls into and affect it all at once with a single CSS property.  
        Also, repitition creates a problem where each individual instance of code has to be changed manually.  Using CSS, classes, and nesting in general allows one to affect most of your content with a few changes instead of having to repeat a single change over and over throughout your code.  

        Not sure what else is needed here since I have been docked twice for not understanding how to avoid repitition.  I really would like to avoid repeitition and am looking forward to moving on so I can learn the function necessary to avoid repitition instead of having to copy and paste opening and closing tags, which is all I know how to do now.  If there is more that my reviewer can tell me about what else to say here, I would love to know!

        Comparing the Mockup
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
       What was super tough for me was comparing the mockup without knowing where to find a good source of information.  Fortunately, I was able to backtrack out of the main IPND course and look at the beginning HTML course to find the link to the samples that we had been introduced to earlier but didn't necessarily get a reference to later on.  It can be found: <a href="http://assignments.udacity-extras.appspot.com/courses/html-css/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>
       <br> <br>
       Using <a href="http://assignments.udacity-extras.appspot.com/courses/html-css/samples/style-1.html" target="blank"> this example</a> I was able to use the developer tools to figure out the spacing and alignment that I would eventually use to create the final mockup.  I can't figure out how to get my banner text to stay in the lower left hand corner of the banner but I'm alright with how it looks.

        <p>
        The &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt; element comes only once in a html document, the opening &lt;body&gt; tag is written after the closing 
&lt;/head&gt; tag, and the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag comes always right before the &lt;/html&gt; tag
        </p>

        An img tag must have an alt attribute, i recommend you to choose an appropriate text equivalent for the object.
